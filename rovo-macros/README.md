# rovo-macros

Internal procedural macros for [rovo](https://github.com/a-line/rovo).

**You're probably looking for the main [rovo](https://crates.io/crates/rovo) crate instead.**

This crate contains the implementation of the `#[rovo]` attribute macro and is not intended to be used directly. It's automatically included as a dependency when you use the `rovo` crate.
